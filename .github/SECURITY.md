# Security Policy

## 🔐 Reporting Security Issues

> Please do not open issues that might have security implications!
>
> It is critical that security related issues are reported privately to ensure we have time to address them before they become public.

Vulnerabilities can be reported by getting in touch with the project stakeholder(s):

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Environment (e.g. Linux / Windows / macOS)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
